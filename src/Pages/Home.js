            CLAWAVE is a visualization toolkit developed to transform water quality
            monitoring and decision-making within Canada and beyond. It utilizes
            both historical and newly gathered water quality data to streamline
            processes for watershed managers, thus expediting the transfer of water
            quality knowledge into actionable strategies. This prototype is designed
            to demonstrate its robust capabilities in various assessing nutrient
            loads in Lake Winnipeg. Additionally, CLAWAVEâ€™s advanced storytelling
            and visualization features are engineered to make water quality data
            more accessible and interpretable for all stakeholders, enhancing
            community involvement and empowering especially Indigenous communities
            to take a more active role in managing their water resources
            effectively.
